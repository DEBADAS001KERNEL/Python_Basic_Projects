Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game created in Python. 
The game lets you play against the computer.

How to Play:
1. Run the script.
2. When prompted, enter your choice: 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors'.
3. The computer will randomly select its choice.
4. The winner is determined based on the following rules:
   - Rock beats Scissors
   - Scissors beats Paper
   - Paper beats Rock
5. The game will display the winner of the round and then end.

The program does not handle draws, so keep that in mind while playing.

Note: Ensure you enter one of the valid choices ('rock', 'paper', or 'scissors') 
to avoid any errors or unexpected behavior.

Enjoy playing!
