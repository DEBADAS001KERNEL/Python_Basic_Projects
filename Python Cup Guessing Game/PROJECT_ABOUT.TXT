Python Cup Guessing Game Explanation

This Python script creates an interactive cup guessing game. The game involves two steps: correctly identifying the cup containing a hidden number and then guessing the hidden number. Here's a breakdown of the code:

Random Number Generation:

The script utilizes the random module to generate a random integer (a) between 1 and 10.
Cups and Cup Selection:

Three cups are represented by the variables cup1, cup2, and cup3, initially set to 0.
Cups are stored in a list (c = ['cup1', 'cup2', 'cup3']).
A cup (C) is randomly chosen using random.choice().
Game Rules Prompt:

The player is presented with the game rules via print() statements.
Instructions guide the player to first choose the correct cup and then guess the hidden number beneath it.
User Input:

The player inputs the name of the chosen cup using input().
If the selected cup matches the randomly chosen cup (C), the player advances to the next level.
Level-1 Success:

Upon a correct cup choice, a success message is displayed.
The player is prompted to input a number.
Number Guessing:

The player guesses a number, and if it matches the initially generated random number (a), the player wins.
Game Outcome:

Success or failure messages are printed based on the player's choices.
Conclusion:

The game concludes with a summary of the outcome.
How to Play:

Run the script.
Follow on-screen instructions to select the correct cup and guess the hidden number.
Note:

Incorrect choices result in game over.
This code serves as a foundation for a guessing game, with potential for further customization or complexity. Enjoy the game, and best of luck
