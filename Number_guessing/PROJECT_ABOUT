Random Number Guessing Game

This is a simple Python program that allows the user to guess a random number between 1 and 10. The user continues to guess until they correctly identify the randomly chosen number.

Game Logic:
1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 10 using the `random` module.
2. The user is prompted to input their guess.
3. The program provides feedback on whether the guessed number is too small or too large.
4. The user continues to guess until they correctly identify the random number.

How to Play:
1. Run the Python script (`random_number_guessing_game.py`).
2. Enter your guess when prompted.
3. Receive feedback and continue guessing until you correctly identify the random number.

Code Explanation:
- The program uses the `random.randint` function to generate a random number.
- A `while` loop is used to continue prompting the user until the correct number is guessed.
- The user is informed if their guess is too small or too large.
- The number of attempts is recorded and displayed at the end.

Sample Usage:
```python
python random_number_guessing_game.py
