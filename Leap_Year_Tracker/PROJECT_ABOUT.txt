Title: Leap Year Checker

Introduction:

The "Leap Year Checker" project is a simple yet essential utility designed to determine whether a given year is a leap year or not. Leap years play a crucial role in various applications, such as calendar systems, financial calculations, and astronomical predictions. This project aims to provide a reliable and efficient tool for users to quickly ascertain the leap year status of any year.

Project Overview:

The project involves developing a Python script that takes input from the user in the form of a year and then performs a series of calculations to determine whether the year is a leap year or not. The script will implement the standard rules for leap year calculation and provide clear and concise output indicating the leap year status of the input year.

Key features of the Leap Year Checker project include:

User Input: The script will prompt the user to enter a year for leap year verification.

Leap Year Calculation: The script will implement the standard rules for leap year calculation:

If the year is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100, it's a leap year.
If the year is divisible by 400, it's a leap year.
Otherwise, it's not a leap year.
Output: The script will display a message indicating whether the input year is a leap year or not.

Project Goals:

Develop a Python script to determine the leap year status of a given year.
Implement the standard rules for leap year calculation.
Ensure robust error handling to handle invalid input and edge cases.
Provide clear and informative output messages for users.
Expected Outcomes:

A reliable and efficient leap year checker tool that accurately determines the leap year status of any given year.
Enhanced user understanding of leap year calculations and concepts.
Increased convenience for users in verifying leap year status for various applications and scenarios.
Conclusion:

The "Leap Year Checker" project serves as a valuable tool for users seeking to verify the leap year status of any given year quickly. By implementing standard leap year calculation rules in a user-friendly Python script, the project aims to promote understanding and facilitate the practical application of leap year concepts in various domains.
